# Write a Python program that prints the length of a string s.
# Expected Output: "" = 0 , "H" = 1 , "Hello" = 5 , "Amazing" = 7

# len function returns length of sequence as integer
# squence may be (string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) 
# or collection (dictionary, set or frozen set)

# pass s as argument for len, print len(s)

s = "12345"
